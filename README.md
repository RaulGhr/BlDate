# BlDate
"Boundless Date" (BlDate) is a web application created in partnership with a high school-based NGO named "Interact." It was developed to address the socialization challenges faced by adolescents in the post-pandemic era. 

BlDate enables users to create accounts, complete a personality questionnaire, and receive compatibility matches. It offers a unique opportunity for teenagers to meet and engage with like-minded individuals on Valentine's Day, aiming to rekindle social connections and provide a platform for adolescents to rebuild their social lives.

The successful launch of BlDate saw 800 registrations within just three days, highlighting its relevance and impact in the post-pandemic landscape.
